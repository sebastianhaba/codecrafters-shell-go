This is a complete solution of 
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

All 28 of 28 stages have been completed and all tests have passed.

In this challenge, you'll build your own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing,
REPLs, builtin commands, and more.
